done!
-----
* Install basic operations of C(A) depending on the existence of the corresponding operations in A
  (adjust the documentation of ChainComplexCategory/CochainComplexCategory, A does not have to be abelian, but simply IsAbCategory)

To do
-----
* Implement the monoidal structure also for cochain complex categories. Try to do this by turning hard coded indices into variables
  to avoid code duplication
* Fix code formatting of AddIsProjective, AddProjectiveLift
* Replace "blabla" in documentation with the actual documentation
