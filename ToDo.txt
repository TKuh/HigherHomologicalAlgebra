Done:
1- Define PreCompose in derived categories
2- Import methods into derived categories, for example HomologyAt and HomologyFunctorialAt ...
3- Make derived categories computable when the underlying abelian has enough projectives or injectives

To Do:
1- Add additive structure to derived categories (using CategoryConstructor package?)
2- Add triangulated structure to derived categories
