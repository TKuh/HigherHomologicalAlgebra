HigherHomologicalAlgebra
=========================


Introduction
------------
The repository is a collection of the Gap packages:

- ComplexesCategories
- Bicomplexes
- HomotopyCategories
- DerivedCategories
- TriangulatedCategories
- QuotientCategories
- StableCategories
- BBGG

The aim of these packages is to carry out categorical and homological constructions on complexes, homotopy or derived categories. The main focus is the construction of derived equivalences that arise via full strong exceptional collections. 

Installation
-----------
The packages can easily be obtained by cloning the repository
[HigherHomologicalAlgebra](https://github.com/homalg-project/HigherHomologicalAlgebra)
in the pkg directory of the Gap installation.

Required packages
-----------------

* This package is written to handle categories that are already implemented in CAP, so you will need a fresh version of CAP. You may install it from [GAP_project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project)

* You will also need [homalg_project](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project.git)

* Other needed packages
