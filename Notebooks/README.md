This directory contains a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks demonstrating the functionality the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) meta-package [HigherHomologicalAlgebra](https://github.com/homalg-project/HigherHomologicalAlgebra#readme), which is based on the

* [homalg project](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project/),
* [CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project/).

These notebooks use the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package [CapAndHomalg](https://github.com/homalg-project/CapAndHomalg.jl).

The notebooks are best viewed on the [jupyter nbviewer page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/homalg-project/HigherHomologicalAlgebra/tree/master/Notebooks/).
There you can also interactively run the notebooks online by clicking on `Binder`'s three-circle-logo (tooltip `Execute on Binder`) at the top-right corner.
